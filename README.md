# QRCode
# The purpose of the QR Code is to patient consumers to a Google form where they would be asked to rate the customer service at Memorial Hermann
# The information from the form would be linked to a spreadsheet that would organize the data via an API
# This QR Code will be dispersed to different clinics so executive level Memorial Hermann employees can recieve customer feedback from specific clinics as to patient experience
